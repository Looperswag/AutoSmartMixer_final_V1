# Core AI and ML Libraries
openai-whisper>=20231117
sentence-transformers>=2.2.2
torch>=2.0.0 # Whisper and SentenceTransformers depend on PyTorch
torchaudio>=2.0.0 # Often needed with torch for audio operations
torchvision>=0.15.0 # Often needed with torch

# Media Processing
moviepy>=1.0.3
# Pillow is a dependency of moviepy and sometimes needs to be explicit
Pillow>=9.0.0

# Configuration and Utilities
PyYAML>=6.0 # For reading config.yaml
tqdm>=4.60.0 # For progress bars, optional but good for UX

# Note:
# 1. Versions are examples; you might need to adjust them based on compatibility
#    or specific features you require.
# 2. If you plan to use a specific version of CUDA with PyTorch,
#    you might install PyTorch using the specific command from pytorch.org, e.g.:
#    pip install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu118
#    Ensure this matches the CUDA version whisper and sentence-transformers expect or can use.
# 3. Some of these packages have many dependencies of their own.
#    It's good practice to generate this file from a clean virtual environment:
#    pip freeze > requirements.txt
