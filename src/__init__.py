# src/__init__.py

# This file makes the 'src' directory a Python package.
# You can leave it empty or use it to make imports easier
# by importing key modules/classes to the package level.

# For example, if you want to be able to do `from src import main_function`
# instead of `from src.main import main_function`, you could add:
# from .main import main_function

# For now, we'll keep it simple.
# Specific functionalities will be imported directly from their respective modules.
